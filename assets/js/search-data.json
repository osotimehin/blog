            "content": "Introduction . The covid-19 pandemic poses great public health and economic challenges to countries around the world. Slowing down the spread of the pandemic requires implementing social distancing measures that disrupt economic activity. At the same time, some activities need to be maintained, which puts workers in these sectors at risk of contracting the virus. How does the workers&#39; exposure to these health and economic risks vary across sectors? How do these risks propagate across sectors? . Methodology . We provide, for 43 countries, a measure of each sector&#39;s exposure to the health and economic risks that captures the spillover from the two groups of workers the hardest it by the pandemic. . The first group of workers bears a higher health risk than other workers. These are people working in sectors providing essential goods and services, such as health care, food or pharmaceutical products. At the risk of being infected, workers in those sectors are asked to continuing working to ensure that the population&#39;s essential needs are met, even when strict lockdown measures are imposed. . | The second group of workers bears a higher economic risk than other workers. These are people working in establishments providing services to the public, such as hotels, restaurants, or cinemas, which we call social consumption sectors. These establishments are likely to operate at low occupancy, even as government-mandated closings are lifted, both because social distancing reduces the number of customers that they can serve and because customers will most likely avoid these establishments until a vaccine or a treatment becomes available. . | . The methodology is based on a simple input-output framework, calibrated on data from the World Input Output Database. We describe the methodology in detail in the working paper. . We measure the health risk as the proportion of workers needed at the workplace to maintain the pre-pandemic household consumption in essential goods and services. We combine the model&#39;s result with Dingel and Neiman&#39;s (2020) work-at-home indicator to calculate a lower bound of the proportion of workers needed at the workplace. . | We measure the economic risk as the decline in employment induced by a 90% drop in household demand for social consumption. We assume that the sales of agricultural, food and chemical products remain at their pre-pandemic levels. . | Note that some of the parameters relative to the trade and transportation sectors are calibrated on US data; The results for other countries are therefore not as conclusive and should be interpreted with this caveat in mind. . | . Results . Visualizations by Julien Duranton . Sectors most exposed to health risks . Sectors most exposed to economic risks .",

            "content": "Introduction . The covid-19 pandemic poses great public health and economic challenges to countries around the world. Slowing down the spread of the pandemic requires implementing social distancing measures that disrupt economic activity. At the same time, some activities need to be maintained, which puts workers in these sectors at risk of contracting the virus. . How does the workers&#39; exposure to these health and economic risks vary across sectors? Answering that question involves understanding not only how sectors vary in their direct exposure to both types of risk but also in their indirect exposure, through supply chains and demand linkages—the intricate network that constitutes the macroeconomy. . Methodology . We provide, for 43 countries, a measure of each sector&#39;s exposure to the health and economic risks. We focus on how risks cascade from the two groups of workers hardest it by the pandemic. . The first group bears a higher health risk than other workers. These are people working in sectors providing essential goods and services, such as health care, food or pharmaceutical products. At the risk of being infected, workers in those sectors are asked to continuing working to ensure that the population&#39;s essential needs are met, even when strict lockdown measures are imposed. . | The second group bears a higher economic risk than other workers. These are people working in establishments providing services to the public, such as hotels, restaurants, or cinemas, which we call social consumption sectors. These establishments are likely to operate at low occupancy, even as government-mandated closings are lifted, both because social distancing reduces the number of customers that they can serve and because customers will most likely avoid these establishments until a vaccine or a treatment becomes available. . | . The methodology is based on a simple input-output framework, with both supply and demand links, calibrated on data from the World Input Output Database. We describe the methodology in detail in the working paper. . We measure the health risk as the proportion of workers needed at the workplace to maintain the pre-pandemic household consumption in essential goods and services. We combine the model&#39;s result with Dingel and Neiman&#39;s (2020) work-at-home indicator to calculate a lower bound of the proportion of workers needed at the workplace. . | We measure the economic risk as the decline in employment following a 90% drop in household demand for social consumption. We assume that the household retail purchases of agricultural, food and chemical products remain at their pre-pandemic levels. . | We calculate the country-level risk as the employment-weighted average of the sectoral risk indicator. . | Note that some parameters (share of online trade, share of passenger transportation, and share of transportation devoted to agricultural, food and chemical products) are calibrated on US data; The results for other countries should be interpreted with this caveat in mind. . | . Risk exposure across sectors . We report here the health and economic-risk measure by country. Select the country of your choice, and for the economic-risk measure, you can select either the scope of the shutdown: either one of the social-consumption sectors or all of them. . Health risk .

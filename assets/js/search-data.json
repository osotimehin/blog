            "content": "Introduction . The covid-19 pandemic poses great public health and economic challenges to countries around the world. Slowing down the spread of the pandemic requires implementing social distancing measures that disrupt economic activity. At the same time, some activities need to be maintained, which puts workers in these sectors at risk of contracting the virus. How does the workers&#39; exposure to these health and economic risks vary across sectors? How do these risks propagate across sectors? . Methodology . We focus on how risk cascade from the two groups of workers the hardest it by the pandemic. . The first group of workers bears a higher health risk than other workers. These are people working in sectors providing essential goods and services, such as health care, food or pharmaceutical products. At the risk of being infected, workers in those sectors are asked to continuing working to ensure that the population&#39;s essential needs are met, even when strict lockdown measures are imposed. . | The second group of workers bears a higher economic risk than other workers. These are people working in establishments providing services to the public, such as hotels, restaurants, or cinemas, which we call social consumption sectors. These establishments are likely to operate at low occupancy, even as government-mandated closings are lifted, both because social distancing reduces the number of customers that they can serve and because customers will most likely avoid these establishments until a vaccine or a treatment becomes available. . | . We provide, for 43 countries, a measure of each sector&#39;s exposure to the health and economic risks that captures the spillover from the two groups of workers. . The methodology is based on a simple input-output framework, calibrated on data from the World Input Output Database. We describe the methodology in detail in the working paper. . We measure the health risk as the proportion of workers needed at the workplace to maintain the pre-pandemic household consumption in essential goods and services. We combine the model&#39;s result with Dingel and Neiman&#39;s (2020) work-at-home indicator to calculate the proportion of workers needed at the workplace. . | We measure the economic risk as the decline in employment induced by a 90% decline in household demand for social consumption.

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .

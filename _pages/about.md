I am Sophie Osotimehin, an Assistant Professor of Economics at the [University of Quebec at Montreal](https://uqam.ca/). I obtained my PhD in Economics from the [Paris School of Economics - Paris 1 University](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/) with a fellowship from the [Center for Research in Economics and Statistics](http://crest.science/).

I study the sources of countries' productivity. I am interested in innovation, as well as in the role of the firms' hiring, investment and intermediate-input decisions for productivity. Recently, I have constructed models to study the effects of labor-market regulation and the consequences of firms' monopoly power on countries' productivity.  

I post here non-technical summaries of my research findings.

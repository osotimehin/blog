I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at the [University of Quebec at Montreal](https://uqam.ca/). 
I obtained my PhD in Economics from the [Paris School of Economics - Paris 1 University](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/) with a fellowship from the [Center for Research in Economics and Statistics](http://crest.science/)

I study the sources of countries' productivity, with a particular interest in how firms respond to shocks and frictions and in the role of linkages between firms. 

I post here non-technical summaries of my research findings.
